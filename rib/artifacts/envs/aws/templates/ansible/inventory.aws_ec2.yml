# See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/aws_ec2_inventory.html
# for information on how this works. This dynamic inventory does a look-up with
# AWS (the user must have run `rib aws init` first to set the AWS credentials)
# and uses filters to group instances by the custom ClusterRole tag (set by the
# Cloudformation template).
#
# You can run `ansible-inventory -i inventory.aws_ec2.yml --graph` to see all
# dynamically-discovered hosts and the resulting Ansible inventory groups.
